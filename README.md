# Fundamental-Relations-for-Electrostatics-and-Magnetostatics

SKILL ASSESSMENT

INTRODUCTION

Electrostatics and magnetostatics describe electric and magnetic fields under steady, unchanging conditions. Electrostatics focuses on electric charges at rest and the fields they produce, while magnetostatics deals with magnetic fields created by steady currents. The fundamental laws—such as Coulomb’s law, Gauss’s law, the Biot–Savart law, and Ampère’s law—provide the basic tools for understanding how charges and currents interact with their surroundings. These principles form the foundation for many applications in physics and engineering.

Electric Charge

Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience forces in the presence of other charged objects. There are two types of charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, while unlike charges attract. Charge is measured in coulombs (C) and is conserved, meaning it cannot be created or destroyed—only transferred from one object to another.

Charges exist in two forms:

Point charges: Idealized charges with no physical size.

Distributed charges: Spread over a surface, line, or volume.

Direction of the Force

If the charges have like signs, the force is repulsive.

If the charges have opposite signs, the force is attractive.

The force acts along the straight line connecting the two charges.


Electric Field and Electric Potential
Electric Field (E)

An electric field is a region in space where a charged object experiences a force. It describes how a source charge influences other charges around it. The electric field is defined as the force per unit positive test charge placed at a point.

<img width="827" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45ae3f5e-f9cd-48d2-a29d-b47d873e17c9" />

The electric field is a vector, and its direction is:

away from a positive charge

toward a negative charge

Electric Potential (V)

Electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge at a point in an electric field. It is a measure of how much work is required to move a test charge from one point to another.

<img width="891" height="427" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76b4a1ab-a905-4a0d-8d6e-596af3eeeb8c" />

Relationship Between Electric Field and Potential

The electric field is related to the electric potential by the rate of change of potential with distance:

<img width="192" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/523856f1-7b4b-4e95-9399-59e180ee5277" />

This means the electric field points in the direction of decreasing potential.


Gauss’s Law

Gauss’s Law is one of Maxwell’s equations. It relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed by that surface.

Statement

The total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space.

<img width="385" height="75" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ee5e522-750a-4668-b321-6feb8a510889" />

Meaning

Electric flux represents how many electric field lines pass through a surface.

If more charge is inside the surface, more field lines emerge.

Gauss’s law simplifies electric field calculations for highly symmetric charge distributions.

Symmetric Charge Distribution

Gauss’s law becomes easy and powerful when the charge distribution has symmetry, such as:

1. Spherical Symmetry

Example: uniformly charged sphere or point charge.

Electric field is same at all points at distance r from center.

Gaussian surface = sphere.

Result:

  2. Cylindrical Symmetry

Example: infinitely long charged wire.

Electric field is radial and same at equal distances from wire.

Gaussian surface = cylinder.

Result:

 3. Planar Symmetry

Example: infinite charged sheet.

Electric field is uniform and perpendicular to the surface.

Gaussian surface = pillbox.

Result:

Dielectrics and Capacitors
1. Dielectrics

A dielectric is an insulating material that does not allow free movement of charges but can be polarized when placed in an electric field.

Properties of Dielectrics

Polarization

When a dielectric is placed in an electric field, charges inside shift slightly, creating dipoles.
Polarization reduces the effective electric field inside the material.

Summary

Electrostatics and magnetostatics are two major branches of electromagnetism dealing with static (time-independent) fields.

Electrostatics

Deals with electric charges at rest.

Main quantities: Electric field E, Electric potential V, Charge density ρ.

Field is derived from charges using Coulomb’s law, Gauss’s law, and potential relations.

Electric field is conservative (curl E = 0).

Magnetostatics

Deals with steady electric currents (constant in time).

Main quantities: Magnetic field B, Magnetic field intensity H, Current density J.

Field is produced by steady currents using Biot–Savart Law and Ampère’s Law.

Magnetic field is solenoidal (div B = 0).

Both fields are part of Maxwell’s equations under static conditions.
